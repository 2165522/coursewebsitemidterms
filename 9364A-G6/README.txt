/* README.txt */

This project is a course notes website for the subject Web Technologies and Applications.
This submission contains the course notes from prelims, and from midterms. At the end of every
topic, a link to a quiz about that certain topic can be taken by the user. The website
is hard-coded by our group with the help of the CSS Bootstrap 4 Framework, which helped us
make our website responsive to any device screen sizes.
