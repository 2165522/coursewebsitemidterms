In our project, the index.html will serve as the portal in our website. This should be the file that you will open to see
the whole functionality of our website. The 'fonts' folder will serve as our storage of the different fonts that we used in \
our website. The 'img' file has all the images that is in our website. The 'links' folder has the different html files that
will serve as the branch of our main html.
